
QA test report for ToDo management application;
link: https://todolist.james.am/;



bugs && issues:

1. Incorrect numeration index is displayed for tasks;
ex: '3 items left' is displayed when list consist of 4 elements;

2.Items left numeration displays -1 when all tasks marked as completed;

3.Arrow left to 'What need's to be done?' input filed, checks all tasks as marked,
on 2nd click turns darker grey and does nothing,
and on 3rd click unchecks all previously marked list items.
It performs the same way whether 'All', 'Active', or 'Completed' hyperlinks are selected.

4.When the first or 2nd item in the list is marked as "Completed" and "Clear" button is pressed,
checked elements it is not removed as expected. Instead the LAST item in the list regardless if it
was marked as completed or not, while keeping the 1st element in the list while also unchecking it as completed.

5. empty space ' ' element is automatically written in after creating a new task inside the input field,
because of that 'What need's to be done?' text is not displayed either.

6. After entering multiple h letters like 'hhhhhh' in input filed the list changed every 2nd 'h' letter to 'a' returning 'hahaha' in list;
could not get the bug result to reaper after deleting said items;
