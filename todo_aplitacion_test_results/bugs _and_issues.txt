QA test report for ToDo management application;
link: https://todolist.james.am/;


bugs && issues:

1. Incorrect numeration index is displayed for tasks;
ex: '3 items left' is displayed when list consist of 4 elements;

2.'Items left' numeration displays -1 when all tasks marked as completed;

3.(FEATURE?)
Arrow next to 'What need's to be done?' input filed, checks all tasks as marked,
on 2nd click turns darker grey and does nothing,
and on 3rd click unchecks all previously marked list items.
It performs the same way whether 'All', 'Active', or 'Completed' are selected.

4. empty space ' ' element is automatically written in after creating a new task inside the input field,
because of that 'What need's to be done?' text is not displayed either.
